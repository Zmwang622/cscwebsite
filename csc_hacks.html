    <h3>Beginners are welcome:</h3>
    <p class="font-weight-normal h4 mb-3">For those who have zero programming experience or aren't a CS major: we encourage you participate! This is a great opportunity to challenge yourself. Pick a language or technology that you're passionate about and learn it! You'll be rewarded for it -- check out the "Best Beginner Project" award below.</p>
    <h3>Total freedom:</h3>
    <p class="font-weight-normal h4 mb-3">Create anything you want, on your schedule, and with a team of your choice (or go solo if that's your thing).</p>
    <h3>Great personal & professional experience:</h3>
    <p class="font-weight-normal h4 mb-3">Working on a personal project is a fun and effective way to gain experience developing software, learn some new skills, and improve your ability to work with a team. For those exact reasons, it also looks really good on a resume!</p>
    <h3>Win prizes:</h3>
    <p class="font-weight-normal h4 mb-5">At the end of the 6 weeks, submit a 2-minute video of your creation, get votes from CSC members, and win up to <strong>$1k</strong> in prizes!</p>
