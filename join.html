					The University of Pittsburgh Computer Science Club, shortened as Pitt CSC, is the University of Pittsburgh's largest and premier computer science student organization. Open to all majors, we host a variety of events that help us build a welcoming and inclusive community of motivated students interested in computer science at Pitt. Our goal is to help create an engaging atmosphere to meet other students, learn more about the field of computer science, and develop professionally.
